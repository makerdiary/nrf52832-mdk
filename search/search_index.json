This will take about 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nConnecting the board\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou need a reasonably current Mac/Linux/Windows PC and a mobile phone to perform the following.\n\n\n\n\nYou can connect the board by performing the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the nRF52832-MDK to one of your PC's USB host ports. This provides power to the board. Observe that two GREEN LEDs are on. One indicates that 3.3V power is good, and another indicates that the application is advertising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a file explorer. Confirm that the nRF52832-MDK has appeared as a removable drive named \nDAPLINK\n. This allows you to program the onboard chip. You'll do this under \"\nhow to program nRF52832-MDK\n\" below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing terminal applications\n\n\nTerminal applications (for example \nPuTTY\n or \nscreen\n) run on your host PC. They provide a window where your board can print messages.\n\n\nYou can connect your board to your computer over USB. This should work out of the box on Linux and macOS, but for Windows earlier than Windows 10, you will probably need to install a serial port driver:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the \nArm Mbed Windows serial port driver\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug in your board over USB. It mounts as a drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose all Explorer windows showing the drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the installer. This may take some time or display a few \"unsigned driver\" warnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerial configuration\n\n\nThe default setup for the USB serial port is 115200 baud, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity (115200-8-N-1)\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows\n\n\nThere are many terminal applications for Windows, \nPuTTY\n is recommended.\n\n\nStart PuTTY and open the used COM port with the following configuration. If there is nothing printed, just press RESET button on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn macOS\n\n\nscreen\n should work on macOS. In Terminal, run:\n\n\n$ screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1412 \n115200\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is nothing printed, just press RESET button on the board.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nYou can type \nscreen /dev/cu.usb\n first, and then press \ntab\n. The device name will autocomplete.\n\n\nTo end a screen session, type \nCtrl\n + \nA\n, and then \nK\n. At the bottom of the Terminal window, you should see a \n[y/n]\n prompt. Type \ny\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Linux\n\n\nscreen\n should work on Linux. If for some reason it doesn't, you can try one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoolTerm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinicom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we will use screen on Ubuntu 16.04 for example. If there is nothing printed, just press RESET button on the board.\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install screen\n\n\n\n\n$ sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 \n115200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing nRF Connect\n\n\nYou can also test the application with nRF Connect by performing the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the \nnRF Connect\n app from App Store or Google Play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the device from nRF Connect (the device is advertising as \nnRF52832-MDK\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that BLUE LED is on and GREEN LED is off. This indicates that the connections is established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that the services are shown in the connected device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite \n01\n to the \nNordic Blinky LED\n Characteristic (0x1525) and observe that RED LED is turned on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite \n00\n to the \nNordic Blinky LED\n Characteristic (0x1525) and observe that RED LED is turned off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to program nRF52832-MDK\n\n\nYou have the following two options to program your nRF52832-MDK: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag-n-drop Programming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing pyOCD\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the firmware\n\n\nDrag-n-drop Programming\n\n\nDrag and drop the hex file into the \nDAPLINK\n removable drive mentioned above. The file contains firmware which will be automatically programmed onto the nRF52832 SoC. This happens immediately. The explorer window may close when programming starts. When programming is completed, the unit will be re-detected by the computer. The application will run after pressing the RESET button.\n\n\nIt's so easy, right?\n\n\n\n\nUsing pyOCD\n\n\npyOCD is an Open Source python 2.7 based library for programming and debugging ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers using CMSIS-DAP. Linux, OSX and Windows are supported.\n\n\nThe latest stable version of pyOCD may be done via \npip\n as follows:\n\n\n$ pip install --pre -U pyocd\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, to install the latest development version (master branch), you can do the following:\n\n\n$ pip install --pre -U https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/archive/master.zip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou may run into permissions issues running these commands. You have a few options here:\n\n\n\n\nRun with \nsudo -H\n to install pyOCD and dependencies globally\n\n\nSpecify the \n--user\n option to install local to your user\n\n\nRun the command in a \nvirtualenv\n local to a specific project working set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify that your board is detected by pyOCD by running:\n\n\n$ pyocd-flashtool -l\n\n\n\n\nand then flash the board by running:\n\n\n$ pyocd-flashtool -d debug -t nrf52 -se your-hex-file.hex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone the repository\n\n\nClone the \nmakerdiary/nrf52832-mdk\n repository or download it as a zip package and put its contents to your working directory.\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/makerdiary/nrf52832-mdk.git\n\n\n\n\nThis repository provides documents and example applications that you can run on your nRF52832-MDK to ensure that everything is set up correctly.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nCreate an Issue\n\n\nInterested in contributing to this project?

After these tests, you can use the examples as starting point to develop your own applications.\n\n\nBefore we begin, we need to install some software components to build our example applications. Here we recommend GNU Arm Embedded Toolchains as they are free and open-source.\n\n\nInstalling GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\n\n\nThe GNU Arm Embedded toolchains are integrated and validated packages featuring the Arm Embedded GCC compiler, libraries and other GNU tools necessary for bare-metal software development on devices based on the Arm Cortex-M and Cortex-R processors. The toolchains are available for cross-compilation on Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS host operating systems.\n\n\nThese toolchains are based on \nFree Software Foundation\n's (FSF) GNU Open source tools and newlib.\n\n\nThe pre-built GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain can be downloaded using the following link: \n\n\nDownload\n\n\nDownload and install the latest version. Then make sure to add the path to your toolchain to your OS PATH environment variable:\n\n\npath to install directory\n/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q2-update/bin\n\n\n\n\nAdding the path makes it possible to run the toolchain executables from any directory using the terminal. To verify that the path is set correctly, type the following in your terminal:\n\n\n$ arm-none-eabi-gcc --version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GNU make\n\n\nNow with the toolchain installed we can build object files from source code, but to build projects based on makefiles, which can be seen as a recipes for the builds, we need to have \nGNU make\n installed on the system.\n\n\nOn Windows the easiest way to install the dependencies is to use the \nMSYS2\n. You can do so by performing the following steps:\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and run the installer - \"x86_64\" for 64-bit, \"i686\" for 32-bit Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the package database and core system packages with:\n\n\n$ pacman -Syu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf needed, close MSYS2, run it again from Start menu. Update the rest with:\n\n\n$ pacman -Su\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\n$ pacman -S git make python2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux and macOS already have the necessary shell commands, but GNU make may not be a part of the standard distro. Call \nmake -v\n from the terminal to check whether it is installed or not. GNU make would need to be installed if it's not recognized as a command.\n\n\nGNU make is bundled with Xcode tools if working on macOS.\n\n\nOn Linux it may be different ways to obtain GNU make depending on your distro, if not installed already. On Ubuntu you can get by entering this command:\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the nRF5 SDK\n\n\nDownload the SDK file \nnRF5_SDK_x.x.x_xxxxxxx.zip\n (for example, \nnRF5_SDK_15.0.0_a53641a.zip\n) from \ndeveloper.nordicsemi.com\n.\n\n\nThe latest version is \n15.0.0\n, it can be downloaded directly here:\n\n\nDownload\n\n\nExtract the zip file to the \nnrf52832-mdk\n repository.

            "text": "nRF5 SDK for Mesh \nSoftware Development Kit for Bluetooth mesh solutions using nRF51 Series and nRF52 Series\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe nRF5 SDK for Mesh is Nordic Semiconductor's implementation of the \nBluetooth Mesh\n. It allows applications to utilize the features provided by the Bluetooth Mesh when running on Nordic's nRF5 Series chips.\n\n\nThe addition of mesh networking capabilities to Bluetooth Low Energy enables extended range, increases the number of nodes and a many-to-many (m:m) communication topology. In a Bluetooth mesh network every received packet is broadcasted by relays, until the packet is received by the destination node (a so called managed flooding mesh.) A simple, but effective way of spreading information across the mesh network with no single point of failure. The mesh functionality is a significant update and enables new applications for Bluetooth in smart home, lighting, beaconing and asset tracking applications.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, go to \nnordicsemi.com\n.\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nYou can find detailed information about Bluetooth Mesh in \nBluetooth SIG's introduction to Bluetooth Mesh\n and the \nBluetooth Mesh Networking Specifications\n.\n\n\nThe following documentation sections provide detailed information about the required software toolchains and the process of building a mesh stack.\n\n\nInstalling the toolchain\n\n\nTo build the example applications, a toolchain based on either CMake is required. Install instructions are provided for macOS. The steps should be similar for other platforms.\n\n\nCMake\n\n\nCMake\n is a build management system used for managing an environment that is independent of the compiler and build system used. Version 3.6 or above is required by the mesh stack.\n\n\nInstall CMake using \nbrew\n on macOS:\n\n\n$ brew install cmake\n\n\n\n\nGNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\n\n\nThe GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm is a ready-to-use, open source suite of tools for C, C++ and Assembly programming targeting Arm Cortex-M and Cortex-R family of processors. It includes the GNU Compiler (GCC) and is available free of charge directly from Arm for embedded software development on Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems.\n\n\nDownload and install the \n6-2017-q2-update\n version. Then make sure to add the path to your toolchain to your OS PATH environment variable:\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n# in ~/.bash_profile, add the following script\n\n\nexport\n \nPATH\n=\npath to install directory\n/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q2-update/bin:\n${\nPATH\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the path makes it possible to run the toolchain executables from any directory using the terminal. To verify that the path is set correctly, type the following in your terminal:\n\n\n$ arm-none-eabi-gcc --version\n\n\n\n\nNinja\n\n\nNinja\n is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.\n\n\nInstall Ninja using \nbrew\n on macOS:\n\n\n$ brew install ninja\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the mesh stack and examples\n\n\nThe mesh library and example applications can be built using \nCMake\n mentioned above.\n\n\nBefore you continue, check \nInstalling the toolchain\n for instructions on setting up the development environment for mesh.\n\n\nDownload the SDKs\n\n\nThe nRF5 SDK for Mesh now requires the nRF5 SDK to compile.

It includes all the features you need to develop a connected product based on an Arm Cortex-M microcontroller, including security, connectivity, an RTOS and drivers for sensors and I/O devices.\n\n\nMbed OS provides a platform that includes:\n\n\n\n\nSecurity foundations.\n\n\nCloud management services.\n\n\nDrivers for sensors, I/O devices and connectivity.\n\n\n\n\nArm Mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand.\n\n\nYour application code is written in C and C++. It uses the application programming interfaces (APIs) that Mbed OS provides. These APIs allow your code to work on different microcontrollers in a uniform way. This reduces the challenges of getting started with Arm-based microcontrollers and integrating large software projects.\n\n\nFor more information, please visit the \nMbed OS developer site\n.\n\n\nUsing Arm Mbed CLI\n\n\nIn the Arm Mbed ecosystem, you have a choice in how you want to develop, Online and Offline. For offline development, Arm Mbed CLI is provided. Mbed CLI is compatible with Windows, Linux and OSX. This option provides more configuration options but also requires slightly more setup.\n\n\nInstall Mbed CLI\n\n\nThe setup process for Arm Mbed CLI depends on your operating system. Please choose your host operating system. The setup instructions for each operating system walk you through how to install Mbed CLI locally.\n\n\nOn Windows the easiest way to install Mbed CLI to run the \nMbed CLI Windows .exe installer\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Windows installer only installs the GNU Arm embedded toolchain. If you want to compile using Arm Compiler 5 or IAR, visit the \nsupported compilers page\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn Linux and macOS, you can use Python and Pip:\n\n\n$ pip install mbed-cli\n\n\n# if you have installed mbed-cli, you can update it with:\n\n$ pip install mbed-cli --upgrade\n\n\n\n\nYou can ensure Mbed CLI installed correctly by running \nmbed help\n from your command-line.\n\n\nSetup environment\n\n\nFor any installed toolchain, be sure to add the Mbed CLI global configuration:\n\n\n$ mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH \npath to GNU Arm bin\n\n\n[\nmbed\n]\n \npath to GNU Arm bin\n now \nset\n as global GCC_ARM_PATH\n\n$ mbed config --list\n\n[\nmbed\n]\n Global config:\n\nGCC_ARM_PATH\n=\npath to GNU Arm bin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can also apply the same configuration to the IAR and ARM toolchains using \nIAR_PATH\n or \nARM_PATH\n.\n\n\n\n\nCompile and program the board\n\n\nNow you can try to compile one of the examples. Will use the \nmbed-os-example-blinky\n example here to keep it simple.\n\n\nOpen terminal and change directory to:\n\n\n$ \ncd\n ./nrf52832-mdk/examples/mbedos5/mbed-os-example-blinky/\n\n\n\n\nAdd mbed-os library to the example directory:\n\n\nmbed-os-example-blinky$ mbed config root .\nmbed-os-example-blinky$ mbed add https://github.com/makerdiary/mbed-os.git\n\n\n\n\nInvoke \nmbed compile\n, and specify the name of your platform and your installed toolchain (GCC_ARM, ARM, IAR). For example, for the NRF52832_MDK platform and GNU Arm embedded toolchain:\n\n\nmbed-os-example-blinky$ mbed compile --target NRF52832_MDK --toolchain GCC_ARM --flash\n\n\n\n\nThe \n--flash\n argument automatically flashes the compiled program onto your board if it is connected to your computer. You can add locally manufacturers id and platform name for nRF52832-MDK and see which boards are connected with \nmbed detect\n:\n\n\n$ mbedls --mock\n=\n1024\n:nRF52832_MDK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that the Green LED is blinking:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nYou can also follow the '\nHow to program nRF52832-MDK\n' section to flash the compiled program.\n\n\n\n\nBLE examples\n\n\nThe \nnrf52832-mdk\n repository contains a collection of BLE example applications based on mbed OS and built with Arm Mbed CLI.\n\n\n./nrf52832-mdk/examples/mbedos5/mbed-os-example-ble\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_BatteryLevel\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_Beacon\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_Button\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_EddystoneObserver\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_EddystoneService\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_GAPButton\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_HeartRate\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_LED\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_LEDBlinker\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BLE_Thermometer\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\n\n\n\nUsing a command-line tool, navigate to any of the example directories, like \nBLE_BatteryLevel\n:\n\n\n$ \ncd\n BLE_BatteryLevel\n\n\n\n\nAdd mbed-os library to the example directory:\n\n\nBLE_BatteryLevel$ mbed add https://github.com/makerdiary/mbed-os.git\n\n\n\n\nCompile and run the example application on your board:\n\n\nBLE_BatteryLevel$ mbed compile --target NRF52832_MDK --toolchain GCC_ARM --flash\n\n\n\n\nOpen the \nnRF Connect\n app on your phone.

Mbed OS provides a platform that includes:   Security foundations.  Cloud management services.  Drivers for sensors, I/O devices and connectivity.   Arm Mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand.  Your application code is written in C and C++. It uses the application programming interfaces (APIs) that Mbed OS provides. These APIs allow your code to work on different microcontrollers in a uniform way. This reduces the challenges of getting started with Arm-based microcontrollers and integrating large software projects.  For more information, please visit the  Mbed OS developer site .",

Examples of these devices are connected locks, lights, and wearables.\n\n\nAs more and more devices get connected, these interconnected devices perform complex tasks. To perform these tasks, you need low-level operational functionality built into the operating system. Typically, connected devices built with these microcontrollers perform a myriad of functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworking Stacks: Bluetooth Low Energy and Thread\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeripherals: PWM to drive motors, ADCs to measure sensor data, and RTCs to keep time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Processing: actions must happen on a calendared or periodic basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Mynewt accomplishes all the above easily, by providing a complete operating system for constrained devices, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fully open-source Bluetooth Low Energy stack with both Host and Controller implementations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pre-emptive, multi-tasking Real Time operating system kernel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that abstracts the MCU's peripheral functions, allowing developers to easily write cross-platform code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewt\n\n\nIn order to provide all this functionality, and operate in an extremely low resource environment, Mynewt provides a very fine-grained source package management and build system tool, called \nnewt\n.\n\n\nYou can install newt for \nmacOS\n, \nLinux\n, or \nWindows\n.\n\n\nInstalling Newt on macOS\n\n\nNewt is supported on macOS 64 bit platforms and has been tested on macOS Sierra.\n\n\nIf this is your first time installing newt, add the \nruntimeco/homebrew-mynewt\n tap:\n\n\n$ brew tap runtimeco/homebrew-mynewt\n$ brew update\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to install the latest release version of newt:\n\n\n$ brew update\n$ brew install mynewt-newt\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Newt on Linux\n\n\nRun the following commands to upgrade or install the latest version of newt:\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install newt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you encounter build errors (such as missing \nsys/mman.h\n), please make sure you have a 32-bit glibc:\n\n$ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Newt on Windows\n\n\nOn Windows, we use MSYS2 as the development environment to build and run Mynewt OS applications for target boards. You can do so by performing the following steps:\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and run the installer - \"x86_64\" for 64-bit, \"i686\" for 32-bit Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the package database and core system packages with:\n\n\n$ pacman -Syu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf needed, close MSYS2, run it again from Start menu. Update the rest with:\n\n\n$ pacman -Su\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\n$ pacman -S git tar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and unpack the newt source:\n\n\n$ wget -P /tmp https://github.com/apache/mynewt-newt/archive/mynewt_1_3_0_tag.tar.gz\n$ tar -xzf /tmp/mynewt_1_3_0_tag.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the \nbuild.sh\n to build the newt tool.\n\n\n$ \ncd\n mynewt-newt-mynewt_1_3_0_tag   \n$ ./build.sh\n$ rm /tmp/mynewt_1_3_0_tag.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see the \nnewt/newt.exe\n executable.

It is designed for devices with as little as 128kB Flash and 8kB RAM.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nEspruino\n is a JavaScript interpreter for microcontrollers. It is designed for devices with as little as 128kB Flash and 8kB RAM.\n\n\nUnlike other boards that run JavaScript, Espruino fits everything it needs into single chip. This makes it affordable, reliable, and power efficient - allowing it to run for years on a battery.\n\n\nEspruino plugs in to your computer by USB and appears as a serial device. No drivers, and no special software. Just run a terminal application and start writing code right away!\n\n\nEspruino comes with its own IDE which installs in seconds and provides a modern Syntax Highlighted editor with code completion. It even automatically loads any modules you need from the internet.\n\n\nThe optional graphical editor makes it quick and easy to create simple devices, even if you've never programmed before.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, please visit \nEspruino Official site\n.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nThis section will show you how to getting started with Espruino using the nRF52832-MDK board. The instructions are provided for macOS. The steps should be similar for other platforms. \n\n\nReady? Let's start!\n\n\nFlashing Espruino\n\n\nBefore we begin coding, we need to program the board with the Espruino firmware. You can get the latest Espruino firmware with the name \nespruino_x.x_nrf52832_mdk.hex\n in the directory \n./nrf52832-mdk/firmware/espruino/\n.\n\n\nConnect the nRF52832-MDK to one of your PC's USB host ports. Then drag and drop the hex file into the \nDAPLINK\n removable drive.\n\n\nWhen programming is completed, the unit will be re-detected by the computer. Espruino will run after pressing the RESET button.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Espruino Web IDE\n\n\nWe recommend that you use the Chrome Web App. It has a bunch of extra features, including graphical editor. You can do so by performing the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \nChrome Web Browser\n if you don't have one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to get the Espruino Web IDE\n and click \n+FREE\n in the top right to install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Espruino Web IDE from Chrome's home screen (or the App Launcher)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting your board\n\n\nNow you can connect your board with the Espruino Web IDE. \n\n\nClick the \nConnect/Disconnect\n icon in the top left.\n\n\nChoose \nWeb Bluetooth\n if your PC has \nBluetooth low energy\n supported, or choose serial port connection(For example, \n/dev/tty.usbmodem1412\n):\n\n\n\n\nFor \nWeb Bluetooth\n connection, you should pair the device next:\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, it will show the board is connected:\n\n\n \n\n\nWriting \n Running your code\n\n\nTry typing the following in the left-hand side of the Web IDE, and press \nEnter\n after it:\n\n\n \n1\n+1\n\n\n digitalWrite\n(\nLED1,1\n)\n\n\n\n digitalWrite\n(\nLED1,0\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also write your code in the right-hand side of the Web IDE. Will use the \nblinky\n example here to keep it simple.\n\n\nvar\n  \non\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n\nsetInterval\n(\nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n  \non\n \n=\n \n!\non\n;\n\n  \nLED1\n.\nwrite\n(\non\n);\n\n\n},\n \n500\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nUpload\n icon to run the example on your board. Observe that the GREEN LED is blinking.\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. Now you've got an idea of how to use Espruino.\n\n\nHow to update Espruino firmware\n\n\nOver time, more features will be added to the Espruino firmware. You may want to update the latest firmware. This section will show how to update the latest firmware by the following options:\n\n\n\n\nDrag-n-drop Programming\n\n\nUsing Web Bluetooth Secure DFU\n\n\n\n\nDrag-n-drop Programming\n\n\nThe latest firmware is located in the directory \nfirmware/espruino/\n of the repository \nnrf52832-mdk\n. For example, \nespruino_1v96.3727_nrf52832_mdk.hex\n.\n\n\nConnect the nRF52832-MDK to one of your PC's USB host ports. Then drag and drop the hex file into the \nDAPLINK\n removable drive.\n\n\nWhen programming is completed, the unit will be re-detected by the computer. Espruino will run after pressing the RESET button.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Web Bluetooth Secure DFU\n\n\nThe released firmwares support \nBluetooth Secure DFU\n feature. If your PC has \nBluetooth low energy\n supported, you can update the firmware by performing the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Chrome Web Browser, go to the page: \nWeb Bluetooth Secure DFU\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire \nP18\n to \n3V3\n, and the power up your board. Observe that the BLUE and RED LEDs are on. Remove the wire, observe that the BLUE is on. It shows that the board is at DFU mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the firmware package or drag it to the page. The latest firmware package is located in \nnrf52832-mdk/firmware/espruino/\n with the name \nespruino_x.x_nrf52832_mdk.zip\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the device with the name \nDfuTarg\n and pair it. Observe that the RED is on, showing that it's uploading. Waiting update complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to build Espruino\n\n\nThis section will show you how to build your own Espruino firmware.\n\n\nSetting up the development environment\n\n\nThe GNU Arm Embedded toolchains is needed to build Espruino.\n\n\nDownload and install the GNU Arm Embedded toolchains. Then make sure to add the path to your toolchain to your OS PATH environment variable:\n\n\npath to install directory\n/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q1-update/bin\n\n\n\n\nAdding the path makes it possible to run the toolchain executables from any directory using the terminal.

Unlike other boards that run JavaScript, Espruino fits everything it needs into single chip. This makes it affordable, reliable, and power efficient - allowing it to run for years on a battery.  Espruino plugs in to your computer by USB and appears as a serial device. No drivers, and no special software. Just run a terminal application and start writing code right away!  Espruino comes with its own IDE which installs in seconds and provides a modern Syntax Highlighted editor with code completion. It even automatically loads any modules you need from the internet.  The optional graphical editor makes it quick and easy to create simple devices, even if you've never programmed before.   For more information, please visit  Espruino Official site .",

            "text": "MicoPython \nA lean and efficient Python implementation for microcontrollers and constrained systems\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nMicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.\n\n\nMicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it is compact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.\n\n\nMicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system.\n\n\nIf in doubt, remember the Zen of MicroPython:\n\n\nCode,\nHack it,\nLess is more,\nKeep it simple,\nSmall is beautiful,\nBe brave! Break things! Learn and have fun!\nExpress yourself with MicroPython.\nHappy hacking! :-)\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, please visit the \nMicroPython Official Site\n.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nFollow this tutorial to get started with MicroPython on nRF52832-MDK.\n\n\nFlashing MicroPython\n\n\nBefore starting coding, you will need to program nRF52832-MDK with the MicroPython firmware. The MicroPython firmware for nRF52832-MDK is available in the directory \n./nrf52832-mdk/firmware/micropython/\n.\n\n\nConnect the nRF52832-MDK to one of your PC's USB host ports. Then drag and drop the hex file into the \nDAPLINK\n removable drive.\n\n\nWhen programming is completed, the unit will be re-detected by the computer. Espruino will run after pressing the RESET button.\n\n\n\n\nRunning your first script\n\n\nConnect the nRF52832-MDK to your PC and then start a terminal application (for example \nPuTTY\n or \nscreen\n). Will use the \nscreen\n application here, you will get a MicroPython REPL prompt:\n\n\n$ screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1412 \n115200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nREPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop. Using the REPL is by far the easiest way to test out your code and run commands.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have a prompt you can start experimenting! Anything you type at the prompt will be executed after you press the Enter key. MicroPython will run the code that you enter and print the result (if there is one). If there is an error with the text that you enter then an error message is printed.\n\n\nTry typing the following at the prompt:\n\n\n \nprint\n(\nhello micropython!\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTry typing \nhelp()\n at the prompt to get more helpful information:\n\n\n\n\nBlinking an LED\n\n\nNow you can try to make a real LED blink using the following Python code:\n\n\nfrom\n \nmachine\n \nimport\n \nPin\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\n\nled\n \n=\n \nPin\n(\nPA22\n,\n \nPin\n.\nOUT\n)\n\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nrange\n(\n0\n,\n \n10\n):\n\n    \nled\n.\nvalue\n(\n1\n)\n\n    \ntime\n.\nsleep_ms\n(\n500\n)\n\n    \nled\n.\nvalue\n(\n0\n)\n\n    \ntime\n.\nsleep_ms\n(\n500\n)\n\n\n\nprint\n(\nDone!\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that the GREEN LED is blinking. That's it. Now you've got an idea of how to use MicroPython.\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nThere are many features that were not covered in this tutorial. The best way to learn about them is to read the full documentation of the modules, and to experiment!\n\n\nGood luck creating your Internet of Things devices!\n\n\nHow to build MicroPython\n\n\nThis section will show you how to build your own MicroPython firmware.\n\n\nSetting up the development environment\n\n\nThe GNU Arm Embedded toolchains is needed to build Espruino.\n\n\nDownload and install the GNU Arm Embedded toolchains. Then make sure to add the path to your toolchain to your OS PATH environment variable:\n\n\npath to install directory\n/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q2-update/bin\n\n\n\n\nAdding the path makes it possible to run the toolchain executables from any directory using the terminal. To verify that the path is set correctly, type the following in your terminal:\n\n\n$ arm-none-eabi-gcc --version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe latest version of GNU Arm Embedded toolchain maybe not work fine, but you can just have a try.\n\n\n\n\nCompiling and flashing MicroPython\n\n\nPrerequisite steps for building the nrf port:\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/makerdiary/micropython.git\n$ \ncd\n micropython\n$ git submodule update --init\n$ make -C mpy-cross\n\n\n\n\nChange directory to \nnrf\n and prepare the bluetooth folder by downloading Bluetooth LE stacks and headers:\n\n\nmicropython$ \ncd\n nrf\nnrf$ ./drivers/bluetooth/download_ble_stack.sh\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Bluetooth stacks has been downloaded, connect nRF52832-MDK to your current PC. Now you can compile the target with the following command:\n\n\n$ make \nBOARD\n=\nnrf52832_mdk \nSD\n=\ns132 sd \nFLASHER\n=\npyocd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nmake sd\n will trigger a flash of the bluetooth stack before that application is flashed.

MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it is compact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.  MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system.  If in doubt, remember the Zen of MicroPython:  Code,\nHack it,\nLess is more,\nKeep it simple,\nSmall is beautiful,\nBe brave! Break things!
